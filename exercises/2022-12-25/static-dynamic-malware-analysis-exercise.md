# Static and dynamic malware analysis exercise

Date: `Sun 25 Dec 2022 14:31:52 IST`

# Questions

1) What should be the VM configuration before malware analysis?
2) What are the limitations of static and dynamic malware analysis?
3) Why do we need to emulate network connectivity?
4) Can a malware escape the VM?
5) Find more disassemblers and debuggers tools and list them

# 1. VM config before malware analysis

- Host only, no shared folders.
- No ping between host and outside network.

# 2. Limitations of static/dynamic analysis

- Static -  can't see behavior or functionality while running.
- Dynamic - while running or executing the malware.

# 3. Why emulate network connectivity?

# 4. Can malware escape VM?

Yes. There can always be vulnerabilities in the VM software, or user error configuring the machine.

# 5. Disassembler and debugger tools list

- IDA 
- TrID
- PE Studio
- CFF Explorer
- WinHex
- PEiD
- API Monitor
- Fiddler
- Scylla

# Hand-On labs

Write a detailed report a using the tools and techniques we learned to analyze
the suspected files (static and dynamic).

# Lab 1

## Files:

1) [`financials-xls.exe`](../2022-12-26/financials-xls.exe.md)
2) [`budget-report.exe`](budget-report.exe.md)

Write a report that will be divided into two parts (or more): Static and Dynamic
analysis.

In each step write what you found based on the guidelines.

# Guidelines:

- IoC (Indicators of Compromise)
    - URLs, IPs, domains, packed/unpacked, files created, registry keys, process, HTML pages, HTTP requests, DNS requests, hashes
- Online resources
    - VirusTotal, hybrid-analysis
- Strings
- Sections permissions
- Suspicious DLLs, suspicious functions
- Malware persistency
    - Registry keys?
- Resources
    - Images, icons, documents
- System changes, network traffic, etc
- Based on the analysis:
    - What the malware is doing?
    - What kind of malware?
