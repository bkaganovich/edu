# Question

```
5.  It’s the middle of the night, suddenly you are receiving an email. Since 
    you are not familiar with the sender, and as a security expert, before opening 
    any attachment, you first want to check it. The email message contains .doc 
    file (SHA1 - 776c469861c3ac30aa63d9434449498456864653).

    Use web resources to explain:

    a.  What is the delivery method the attacker is using?
    b.  How is this file related to the domain - gamestoredownload.download?
    c.  The final payload of this malware is the file: gamepa.exe, which tries 
        to steal different types of credentials from the infected host.
        
        i. How would you classify this malware?
        ii. Based on hybrid-analysis report, what is the C2 server of this malware?
